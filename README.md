Adopt A Pet
===========
Project 3 of GDGNJ Android 2017: this is a single screen app to demonstrate some Android basic UI
concepts we've learned so far.

I used a fictitious pet adoption agency for this project, who knows if it's enhanced thru the course
it could be ported to real agencies.

I used styles/themes in the app but have more to learn as I had a difficult time trying tweak the
application text, and toolbar.  Regarding toolbar I know it's probably not encouraged to do what
I did, and we're probably supposed to leave 'well enough alone', but I wanted to learn so
experimented with it (couldn't get it working with xml so modified toolbar in code).

I also wanted to play with intents so I included three, if you click on the address it'll bring up
google maps (with the street view), clicking the phone will bring up the phone keypad and pre-dial
the number, clicking the website will launch the web browser.  Note: since I used a fictitious
business I used a local pet adoption agency for the address/websites.
